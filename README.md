# Global Vaccination Coverage and Economic Dashboard

## Introduction

Welcome to the Global Vaccination Coverage and Economic Dashboard! This interactive data visualization tool is designed to explore the progress and patterns of global vaccination coverage from 1990 to 2019. It emphasizes the DTP3 (Diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) immunization rate across countries and correlates it with economic indicators like GDP per capita and population sizes.

## Features

### Interactive Data Visualizations:

1. **Choropleth Map:** Displays the vaccination coverage for each country, allowing users to select specific years and observe changes and trends over time.

2. **Comparative Line Chart:** Enables comparisons of vaccination coverage across multiple countries over the period from 1990 to 2019. This feature helps in understanding the growth and trajectories in healthcare across different nations.

3. **Scatter Plot:** Illustrates the relationship between GDP per capita and vaccination coverage, with each country represented by a point sized according to its population. This visualization highlights the economic impacts on health infrastructure.

4. **Ridgeline Plot:** Offers a unique way to analyze the distribution of countries based on their vaccination coverage within different GDP per capita tiers, allowing for easy comparison between economic strata.

### Data Source

The data for this dashboard is sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination), ensuring reliability and comprehensive coverage of global vaccination statistics.
